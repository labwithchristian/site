The long form: how I worked a problem, what I decided and the evidence behind it. What lands here:

- Walkthroughs of retired Hack The Box and TryHackMe boxes
- LetsDefend and other blue team lab investigations
- CTF postmortems and lessons learned, after each event closes
- Coursework and projects from the [lab]({{< ref "homelab" >}})

Configs and detection rules go on [GitHub](https://github.com/labwithchristian).

## What's planned

The lab's six projects follow keraattin's [Blue Team Roadmap](https://github.com/keraattin/Blue-Team-Roadmap#phase-9-build-your-portfolio), plus one of my own. Each project ends in at least one writeup here.

| Writeup | Covers | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Network segmentation | The three segments, the OPNsense rules between them, and why the malware segment has no way out | Lab |
| SIEM deployment and dashboards | Windows, Sysmon and network logs in Elastic Security and Security Onion, and the detections and dashboards built on top | Project 1 |
| Adversary emulation | Atomic Red Team techniques run on purpose, what the SIEM caught, and the rules written for what it missed | Project 2 |
| Phishing analysis | One email taken apart end to end, and the script that pulls out its IOCs | Project 3 |
| Incident response reports | Full investigations from retired boxes and blue team labs (Hack The Box, TryHackMe, LetsDefend): summary, timeline, IOCs, ATT&CK mapping, remediation | Project 4 |
| Threat intelligence brief | One threat group's techniques, turned into detections tested in the lab | Project 5 |
| Detection rules | Sigma and YARA rules, how they were tested, and the pull requests upstream | Project 6 |
| Vulnerability management | Qualys agent and network scans of the same hosts compared, and one finding followed from scan to verified fix | Added project |
| CTF writeups | Challenges from scored competitions: approach, tools and what I would do differently. Published after an event closes, and only where its rules allow | {{< ctf-link >}} |

{{< soon title="Nothing published yet" status="drafting" >}}
First up are incident response reports, since they need no lab build, then segmentation and the SIEM as the lab comes online.

In the meantime, the [Homelab]({{< ref "homelab" >}}) page tracks build status, and the [Blog]({{< ref "blog" >}}) will carry the shorter reasoning behind decisions.
